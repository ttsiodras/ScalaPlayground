Read my original question to StackOverflow to understand the algorithm
I implemented:

TL;DR:

I wanted to see how Scala fares in a benchmark I did a couple of years
ago - where surprisingly, F# was significantly slower than Python!  Happily,
Scala had no such problems - it didn't require the "handholding" that F# did
(again, see the SO thread).
